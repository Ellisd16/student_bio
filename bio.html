        <p>Hi my name is Ellis Delgado, and I am 23 years old. I recently graduated from San Francisco State University with a degree in Cinema, but am looking for a change of career. Coding is an entirely new field for me, but I've already started having fun working with things like html and css! 
            I can't wait to see how much I improve throughout this course and how much more confident I can become in this field!</p>
